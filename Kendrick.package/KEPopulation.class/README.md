Instance Variables
	compartments:		<Dictionary>
	individuals:		<OrderedCollection>
	diedIndList:		<OrderedCollection>
	attributes:   	         <Dictionary>
	relations: 		<OrderedCollection>
	subPopulations:   <Dictionary>

compartments
	- A collection of compartments in the population, each of them has a name generated by attributes and the set of equivalence relations of this population

individuals
	- A collection of individuals (instances of KEIndividual class)
	
attributes
         - A list of attributes of each individual in the population

relations
	- A set of equivalence relationship for partitioning the population in compartments
	
subPopulations
	- Each population can have a list of subPopulations. Each subPopulation is a part of Population in which the relationship and attributes are more complex, allowing to modelling at multi-scale
